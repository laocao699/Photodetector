Table 2.1: Added documentation files


<table><tr><td>File</td><td>Purpose</td></tr><tr><td>BUILD.md</td><td>Building from source</td></tr><tr><td>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</td><td>Code of conduct</td></tr><tr><td>TEST.md</td><td>Testing instructions</td></tr></table>

## 2.8.2 Database command removal

The material database has been removed. 

• devsim.create_db 

• devsim.open_db 

• devsim.close_db 

• devsim.save_db 

• devsim.add_db_entry 

• devsim.get_db_entry 

This feature was only being used in the bioapp1 examples, and those tests have been updated. This also removes the binary dependence on SQLite. 

## 2.9 Version 2.8.0

## 2.9.1 Python scripts

Based on a contribution by [@simbilod](https://github.com/simbilod), all of the Python scripts have been reformatted. The build system was also updated to enforce Python script modifications are properly formatted when submitted to the project. 

## 2.9.2 Data output

Reduction in data file sizes 

Based on a contribution by [@simbilod](https://github.com/simbilod) devsim.write_devices() (page 98) now supports reducing the file size of data files by allowing users to specify a callback function to reduce data usage. In this example, only the NetDoping field is written to the Tecplot data file. 

```python
devsim.write_devices(
    file="mesh2d_reduced.tec",
    type="tecplot", 
```

(continues on next page) 

```txt
include_test=lambda x: x in ("NetDoping"), 
```

(continued from previous page) 

## FLOOPS data file output

The floops option for devsim.write_devices() (page 98) has been removed. 

## 2.9.3 Platform support

## Windows build issue

During testing, it was found the Visual Studio 2022 builds were failing a test related to threading. This was found to be a problem with version 17.10, but not version 17.9. This affects the build automation, but should not affect the binary releases. 

## Centos 7 end of life

This is the last version to support Centos 7 before its end of life on June 30, 2024. After this date we will be moving to the AlmaLinux 8 based manylinux_2_28. 

## 2.10 Previous releases

For older release notes, please refer to the Version 2.8.1 manual located at https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.12211919. The latest version is available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4583208. 

## Chapter 3

## Getting started

## 3.1 Introduction

DEVSIM is a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) software for semiconductor device simulation. While geared toward this application, it may be used where the control volume approach is appropriate for solving systems of partial-differential equations (PDE’s) on a static mesh. After introducing DEVSIM, the rest of the manual discusses the key components of the system, and instructions for their use. 

The primary goal of DEVSIM is to give the user as much flexibility and control as possible. In this regard, few models are coded into the program binary. They are implemented in human-readable scripts that can be modified if necessary. 

DEVSIM has a scripting language interface (User interface (page 14)). This provides control structures and language syntax in a consistent and intuitive manner. The user is provided an environment where they can implement new models on their own. This is without requiring extensive vendor support or use of compiled programming languages. 

SYMDIFF (SYMDIFF (page 53)) is the symbolic expression parser used to allow the formulation of device equations in terms of models and parameters. Using symbolic differentiation, the required partial derivatives can be generated, or provided by the user. DEVSIM then assembles these equations over the mesh. 

## 3.2 Getting help

Please see Contact (page 1) for project contact information. The most responsive method is to contact the online forum at https://forum.devsim.org. Additional information, with links to documentation is available at https://devsim.org. Additional documentation files released with the simulator are presented at https://pypi.org/project/devsim/. 

## 3.3 Supported platforms

DEVSIM is compiled and tested on the platforms in Table 3.1. 


Table 3.1: Current platforms for DEVSIM


<table><tr><td>Platform</td><td>Architecture</td><td>OS Version</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft Windows</td><td>x64</td><td>Microsoft Windows 10</td></tr><tr><td>Linux</td><td>x86_64, aarch64</td><td>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (AlmaLinux 8 compatible)</td></tr><tr><td>Apple macOS</td><td>arm64</td><td>macOS 14.7.6 (Sonoma)</td></tr></table>

These are the minimum supported platforms, and also expected to work on newer versions of these operating systems. If you require a version on a different software platform, please contact us Contact (page 1). 

## 3.4 Install Python

A Python version of 3.7 or higher is needed to run DEVSIM. This requirement is often met by the default installations of the above systems. In addition, it is possible to download other Python versions online. Popular distributions of Python are listed in Table 3.2. 


Table 3.2: Python distributions


<table><tr><td>Vendor</td><td>Path</td><td>Website</td></tr><tr><td>Anaconda</td><td>$CONDA_PREFIX</td><td>https://www.anaconda.com</td></tr><tr><td>Python.org</td><td>$VIRTUAL_ENV</td><td>https://python.org</td></tr></table>

## 3.4.1 Create virtual environment

Creating a virtual environment is needed so DEVSIM may necessary math libraries, as discussed in Default math search path (page 50). The numpy package is also recommended to ensure that needed math libraries are available. 

Anaconda 

Using the conda package manager in an Anaconda, a virtual environment is created using. 

```batch
conda create -n denv python numpy
conda activate denv 
```

where denv is the name of the environment. If you are using a x64 or x86_64 based system, you may install the Intel Math Kernel Library with the Pardiso Solver. 

```txt
conda install mkl 
```

## Using venv

For other Python distributions, the requisite packages may be installed by using a venv based virtual environment. 

```shell
python3 -mvenv denv
source denv/bin/activate
pip install numpy 
```

where denv is the name of directory containing the environment. If you are using a x64 or x86_64 based system, you may install the Intel Math Kernel Library with the Pardiso Solver. 

```batch
pip install mkl 
```

## 3.5 Install DEVSIM

## 3.5.1 Install

DEVSIM is available from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/devsim/) using pip. To install this package for your platform: 

```batch
pip install devsim 
```

Please see the devsim_data/INSTALL.md file in the distribution for more information. This files may be found in the prefix directory for your chosen environment listed in Table 3.2. 

## 3.5.2 Test

To ensure a proper installation, please type the following at a Python prompt. 

```txt
>>> import devsim
Searching DEVSIM_MATH_LIBS="libopenblas.dylib:liblapack.dylib:libblas.dylib"
Loading "libopenblas.dylib": ALL BLAS/LAPACK LOADED
Skipping liblapack.dylib
Skipping libblas.dylib
loading UMFPACK 5.1 as direct solver 
```

Note that there will be an error if no math libraries are available. 

```txt
>>> import devsim
Searching DEVSIM_MATH_LIBS="libopenblas.so:liblapack.so:libblas.so"
Loading "libopenblas.so": MISSING DLL 
```

(continues on next page) 

(continued from previous page) 

```txt

```

## 3.5.3 Running DEVSIM

See User interface (page 14) for instructions on how to invoke DEVSIM. 

## 3.6 Building from source

Building from source is possible, and is useful when you want to extend the simulator, use compiler optimizations, or port to a new platform. See the BUILD.md file in the project files for more information. 

## 3.7 Install external software tools

## 3.7.1 Meshing

## Gmsh

Gmsh [2] is available from https://gmsh.info. DEVSIM is able to import triangular or tetrahedral meshes from this application. More information is in Gmsh (page 42). 

## Other meshers

It is also possible to import other mesh formats by writing a converter in Python, as described in Custom mesh loading using scripting (page 43). 

## 3.7.2 Visualization

See Visualization software (page 61) for a listing of available meshing tools, which are known to work with DEVSIM. 

## 3.7.3 Math libraries

## BLAS and LAPACK

These are the basic linear algebra routines used in DEVSIM and their selection is described in BLAS/LAPACK library selection (page 49). 

## Intel MKL Pardiso

This library may be installed and selected using the instructions in Available libraries (page 48). 

## Chapter 4

## User interface

## 4.1 Starting DEVSIM

Refer to Supported platforms (page 10) for instructions on how to install DEVSIM. Once installed, DEVSIM may be invoked using the following command 

devsim is loaded by calling 

```txt
import devsim 
```

from Python. 

Many of the examples in the distribution rely on the python_packages module, which is available by using: 

```python
import devsim.python_packages 
```

## 4.2 Directory structure

A DEVSIM directory is created with the following sub directories listed in Directory structure for DEVSIM (page 14). 


Table 4.1: Directory structure for DEVSIM


<table><tr><td>devsim_data</td><td>contains project documentation files</td></tr><tr><td>devsim_data/doc</td><td>product documentation</td></tr><tr><td>devsim_data/examples</td><td>example scripts</td></tr><tr><td>devsim_data/testing</td><td>additional examples used for testing</td></tr></table>

This may be found using the virtual environment path specified in Table 3.2. 

## 4.3 Python language

## 4.3.1 Introduction

Python is the scripting language employed as the text interface to DEVSIM. Documentation and tutorials for the language are available from [1]. A paper discussing the general benefits of using scripting languages may be found in [5]. 

## 4.3.2 DEVSIM commands

All of commands are in the devsim namespace. In order to invoke a command, the command should be prefixed with devsim., or the following may be placed at the beginning of the script: 

```python
from devsim import * 
```

## 4.3.3 Unicode support

Internally, DEVSIM uses UTF-8 encoding, and expects model equations and saved mesh files to be written using this encoding. Care should be taken when using non-ASCII characters in names for visualization using the tools in Visualization and post processing (page 61), as this character set may not be supported in these third-party tools. 

## 4.4 Error handling

## 4.4.1 Exceptions

When a syntax error occurs in a Python script an exception may be thrown. If it is uncaught, then DEVSIM will terminate. An exception that is thrown by DEVSIM is of the type devsim.error. It may be caught, and a message may be extracted to determine the issue. 

## 4.4.2 Fatal errors

When DEVSIM enters a state in which it may not recover. The interpreter will throw a devsim.error exception with a message DEVSIM FATAL. At this point DEVSIM may enter an inconsistent state, so it is suggested not to attempt to continue script execution if this occurs. 

In rare situations, the program may behave in an erratic manner, print a message, such as UNEXPECTED or terminate abruptly. Please report this using the contact information in Contact (page 1). 

## 4.4.3 Floating point exceptions

During model evaluation, DEVSIM will attempt to detect floating point issues and return an error with some diagnostic information printed to the screen, such as the symbolic expression being evaluated. Floating point errors may be characterized as invalid, division by zero, and numerical overflow. This is considered to be a fatal error. 

## 4.4.4 Solver errors

When using the devsim.solve() (page 114), the solver may not converge and a message will be printed and an exception may be thrown. The solution will be restored to its previous value before the simulation began. This exception may be caught and the bias conditions may be changed so the simulation may be continued. 

## 4.4.5 Example

More helpful exception information returned to Python if the error is considered fatal. This can be used to decide if the simulation can be restarted. Note that if this occurs during a solve, it is necessary for the user to restore the previous circuit and device solutions if a restart is desired. In addition, model evaluation is reset so that no false cyclic dependencies are reported after an error. 

In this example code below, the previously DEVSIM FATAL error string will now provide the context that a floating point exception occurred and be handled in Python. 

```python
try:
    self.solve()
except error as msg:
    m = str(msg)
    if 'Convergence failure' in m:
    self.set_vapp(last_bias)
    elif 'floating point exception' in m:
    self.set_vapp(last_bias)
    self.restore_callback(self.is_circuit)
    else:
    raise 
```

## 4.5 Verbosity

The set_parameter() may be used to set the verbosity globally, per device, or per region. Setting the debug_level parameter to info results in the default level of information to the screen. Setting this option to verbose or any other name results in more information to the screen which may be useful for debugging. 

The following example sets the default level of debugging for the entire simulation, except that the gate region will have additional debugging information. 

```python
devsim.set_parameter(name="debug_level", value="info")
devsim.set_parameter(device="device" region="gate", name="debug_level", value="verbose") 
```

## 4.6 Command help

It is now possible to see the full list of DEVSIM commands by typing 

```txt
help(devsim.solve) 
```

## 4.7 Parallelization

## 4.7.1 Model evaluation

Routines for the evaluating of models are parallelized. In order to select the number of threads to use 

```python
devsim.set_parameter(name="threads_available", value=2) 
```

where the value specified is the number of threads to be used. By default, DEVSIM does not use threading. For regions with a small number of elements, the time for switching threads is more than the time to evaluate in a single thread. To set the minimum number of elements for a calculation, set the following parameter. 

```python
devsim.set_parameter(name="threads_task_size", value=1024) 
```

The Intel Math Kernel Library is parallelized, the number of thread may be controlled by setting the MKL_NUM_THREADS environment variable. 

## 4.7.2 Long operations

While running long operations, DEVSIM, will yield to the Python to allow it to perform other operations. 

## 4.7.3 External math libraries

Please see the documentation for external solvers, such as BLAS/LAPACK or the Intel MKL Pardiso, on how to control their threading behavior. 

## 4.8 Reset simulator

The devsim.reset_devsim() (page 91) command will clear all simulator data, so that a program restart is not necessary. 

## 4.9 Array type input and output

In most circumstances, the software now returns numerical data using the Python array class. This is more efficient than using standard lists, as it encapsulates a contiguous block of memory. More information about this class can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html. The representation can be easily converted to lists and numpy arrays for efficient manipulation. 

When accepting user input involving lists of homogenous data, such as devsim. set_node_values() (page 112) the user may enter data using either a list, string of bytes, or the array class. It may also be used to input numpy arrays or any other class with a tobytes method. 

## Chapter 5

## Equation and models

## 5.1 Overview

DEVSIM uses the control volume approach for assembling partial-differential equations (PDE’s) on the simulation mesh. DEVSIM is used to solve equations of the form: 

$$
\frac {\partial X}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec {Y} + Z = 0
$$

Internally, it transforms the PDE’s into an integral form. 

$$
\int \frac {\partial X}{\partial t} \partial r + \int \vec {Y} \cdot \partial s + \int Z \partial r = 0
$$

Equations involving the divergence operators are converted into surface integrals, while other components are integrated over the device volume. 

Additional detail concerning the discussion that follows is available in [7, 8]. 

In Mesh elements in 2D (page 20), 2D mesh elements are depicted. The shaded area around the center node is referred to as the node volume, and it is used for the volume integration. The lines from the center node to other nodes are referred to as edges. The flux through the edge are integrated with respect to the perpendicular bisectors (dashed lines) crossing each triangle edge. 

In this form, we refer to a model integrated over the edges of triangles as edge models. Models integrated over the volume of each triangle vertex are referred to as node models. Element edge models are a special case where variables at other nodes off the edge may cause the flux to change. 

There are a default set of models created in each region upon initialization of a device, and are typically based on the geometrical attributes. These are described in the following sections. Models required for describing the device behavior are created using the equation parser described in SYMDIFF (page 53). For special situations, custom matrix assembly is also available and is discussed in Custom matrix assembly (page 31).

## 5.1.1 Structures

Devices A device refers to a discrete structure being simulated. It is composed of the following types of objects. 

Regions A region defines a portion of the device of a specific material. Each region has its own system of equations being solved. 

Interfaces An interface connects two regions together. At the interfaces, equations are specified to account for how the flux in each device region crosses the region boundary. 

Contacts A contact specifies the boundary conditions required for device simulation. It also specifies how terminal currents are are integrated into an external circuit. 

## 5.2 Bulk models

## 5.2.1 Node models

Node models may be specified in terms of other node models, mathematical functions, and parameters on the device. The simplest model is the node solution, and it represents the solution variables being solved for. Node models automatically created for a region are listed in Node models defined on each region ofa device (page 24). 

In this example, we present an implementation of Shockley Read Hall recombination [4]. 

```txt
USRH="-ElectronCharge*(Electrons*Holes - n_i^2)/(taup*(Electrons + n1) \
+ taun*(Holes + p1))")
dUSRHdn="simplify(diff(%s, Electrons))" % USRH
dUSRHdp="simplify(diff(%s, Holes))" % USRH
devsim.node_model(device='MyDevice', region='MyRegion',
name="USRH", equation=USRH)
devsim.node_model(device='MyDevice', region='MyRegion',
name="USRH:Electrons", equation=dUSRHdn)
devsim.node_model(device='MyDevice', region='MyRegion',
name="USRH:Holes", equation=dUSRHdp) 
```

The first model specified, USRH, is the recombination model itself. The derivatives with respect to electrons and holes are USRH:Electrons and USRH:Holes, respectively. In this particular example Electrons and Holes have already been defined as solution variables. The remaining variables in the equation have already been specified as parameters. 

The diff function tells the equation parser to take the derivative of the original expression, with respect to the variable specified as the second argument. During equation assembly, these derivatives are required in order to converge upon a solution. The simplify function tells the expression parser to attempt to simplify the expression as much as possible.

## 5.2.2 Edge models

Edge models may be specified in terms of other edge models, mathematical functions, and parameters on the device. In addition, edge models may reference node models defined on the ends of the edge. As depicted in Edge model constructs in 2D (page 21), edge models are with respect to the two nodes on the edge, n0 and n1. 

For example, to calculate the electric field on the edges in the region, the following scheme is employed: 

```txt
devsim.edge_model(device="device", region="region", name="ElectricField", equation="(Potential@n0 - Potential@n1)*EdgeInverseLength")
devsim.edge_model(device="device", region="region", name="ElectricField:Potential@n0", equation="EdgeInverseLength")
devsim.edge_model(device="device", region="region", name="ElectricField:Potential@n1", equation="-EdgeInverseLength") 
```

In this example, EdgeInverseLength is a built-in model for the inverse length between nodes on an edge. Potential@n0 and Potential@n1 is the Potential node solution on the nodes at the end of the edge. These edge quantities are created using the devsim.edge_from_node_model() (page 102). In addition, the devsim.edge_average_model() (page 102) can be used to create edge models in terms of node model quantities. 

Edge models automatically created for a region are listed in Edge models defined on each region of a device (page 25). 


Table 5.2: Edge models defined on each region of a device


<table><tr><td>Edge Model</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>EdgeCouple</td><td>The length of the perpendicular bisector of an element edge. Used to perform surface integration of edge models on edges in mesh.</td></tr><tr><td>EdgeNodeVolume</td><td>The volume for each node on an edge. Used to perform volume integration of edge models on edges in mesh.</td></tr><tr><td>EdgeInverseLength</td><td>Inverse of the EdgeLength.</td></tr><tr><td>EdgeLength</td><td>The distance between the two nodes of an edge</td></tr><tr><td>edge_index</td><td>Index of the edge on the region</td></tr><tr><td>unitx</td><td>x component of the unit vector along an edge</td></tr><tr><td>unity</td><td>y component of the unit vector along an edge (2D and 3D)</td></tr><tr><td>unitz</td><td>z component of the unit vector along an edge (3D only)</td></tr></table>

## 5.2.3 Element edge models

Element edge models are used when the edge quantitites cannot be specified entirely in terms of the quantities on both nodes of the edge, such as when the carrier mobility is dependent on the normal electric field. In 2D, element edge models are evaluated on each triangle edge. As depicted in Element edge model constructs in 2D (page 22), edge models are with respect to the three nodes on each triangle edge and are denoted as en0, en1, and en2. Derivatives are with respect to each node on the triangle. 

In 3D, element edge models are evaluated on each tetrahedron edge. Derivatives are with respect to the nodes on both triangles on the tetrahedron edge. Element edge models automatically created for a region are listed in Element edge models defined on each region ofa device (page 25). 

As an alternative to treating integrating the element edge model with respect to ElementEdgeCouple, the integration may be performed with respect to ElementNodeVolume. See devsim.equation() (page 87) for more information. 


Table 5.3: Element edge models defined on each region of a device


<table><tr><td>Element Edge Model</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>ElementEdgeCouple</td><td>The length of the perpendicular bisector of an edge. Used to perform surface integration of element edge model on element edge in the mesh.</td></tr><tr><td>ElementNodeVolume</td><td>The node volume at either end of each element edge.</td></tr></table>

## 5.2.4 Model derivatives

To converge upon the solution, derivatives are required with respect to each of the solution variables in the system. DEVSIM will look for the required derivatives. For a model model, the derivatives with respect to solution variable variable are presented in Required derivatives for equation assembly. model is the name of the model being evaluated, and variable is one of the solution variables being solved at each node (page 26). 


Table 5.4: Required derivatives for equation assembly. model is the name of the model being evaluated, and variable is one of the solution variables being solved at each node


<table><tr><td>Model Type</td><td>Derivatives Required</td></tr><tr><td>Node Model</td><td>model:variable</td></tr><tr><td>Edge Model</td><td>model:variable@n0, model:variable@n1</td></tr><tr><td>Element Edge Model</td><td>model:variable@en0, model:variable@en1,model:variable@en2, model:variable@en3 (3D)</td></tr></table>

## 5.2.5 Conversions between model types

The devsim.edge_from_node_model() (page 102) is used to create edge models referring to the nodes connecting the edge. For example, the edge models Potential@n0 and Potential@n1 refer to the Potential node model on each end of the edge. 

The devsim.edge_average_model() (page 102) creates an edge model which is either the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, gradient, or negative of the gradient of the node model on each edge. 

When an edge model is referred to in an element edge model expression, the edge values are implicity converted into element edge values during expression evaluation. In addition, derivatives of the edge model with respect to the nodes of an element edge are required, they are converted as well. For example, edgemodel:variable@n0 and edgemodel:variable@n1 are implicitly converted to edgemodel:variable@en0 and edgemodel:variable@en1, respectively. 

The devsim.element_from_edge_model() (page 104) is used to create directional components of an edge model over an entire element. The derivative option is used with this command to create the derivatives with respect to a specific node model. The devsim.element_from_node_model() (page 105) is used to create element edge models referring to each node on the element of the element edge. 

## 5.2.6 Equation assembly

Bulk equations are specified in terms of the node, edge, and element edge models using the devsim.equation() (page 87). Node models are integrated with respect to the node volume. Edge models are integrated with the perpendicular bisectors along the edge onto the nodes on either end. 

Element edge models are treated as flux terms and are integrated with respect to ElementEdgeCouple using the element_model option. Alternatively, they may be treated as source terms and are integrated with respect to ElementNodeVolume using the volume_node0_model and volume_node1_model option. 

In this example, we are specifying the Potential Equation in the region to consist of a flux term named PotentialEdgeFlux and to not have any node volume terms. 

```python
devsim.equation(device="device", region="region", name="PotentialEquation", variable_name="Potential", edge_model="PotentialEdgeFlux", variable_update="log_damp") 
```

In addition, the solution variable coupled with this equation is Potential and it will be updated using logarithmic damping. 


Table 5.5: Required derivatives for interface equation assembly. The node model name nodemodel and its derivatives nodemodel:variable are suffixed with @r0 and @r1 to denote which region on the interface is being referred to


<table><tr><td>Model Type</td><td>Model Name</td><td>Derivatives Required</td></tr><tr><td>Node Model (region 0)</td><td>nodemodel@r0</td><td>nodemodel:variable@r0</td></tr><tr><td>Node Model (region 1)</td><td>nodemodel@r1</td><td>nodemodel:variable@r1</td></tr><tr><td>Interface Node Model</td><td>inodemodel</td><td>inodemodel:variable@r0, inodemodel:variable@r1</td></tr></table>

## 5.3 Interface

## 5.3.1 Interface models

Interface constructs in 2D. Interface node pairs are locatedat each \bullet. The SurfaceArea model is used to integrate flux term models. (page 28) depicts an interface in DEVSIM. It is a collection of overlapping nodes existing in two regions, r0 and r1. 

Interface models are node models specific to the interface being considered. They are unique from bulk node models, in the sense that they may refer to node models on both sides of the interface. They are specified using the devsim.interface_model() (page 109). Interface models may refer to node models or parameters on either side of the interface using the syntax nodemodel@r0 and nodemodel@r1 to refer to the node model in the first and second regions of the interface. The naming convention for node models, interface node models, and their derivatives are shown in 

![](images/9de9b790206df6ef47d4e60caa07809faef76644abb2c756bda81990f59284b4.jpg)



Fig. 5.4: Interface constructs in 2D. Interface node pairs are located at each •. The SurfaceArea model is used to integrate flux term models.


Required derivatives for interface equation assembly. The node model name nodemodel and its derivatives nodemodel:variable are suffixed with @r0 and @r1 to denote which region on the interface is being referred to (page 27). 

```txt
devsim.interface_model(device="device", interface="interface", name="continuousPotential", equation="Potential@r0-Potential@r1") 
```

## 5.3.2 Interface model derivatives

For a given interface model, model, the derivatives with respect to the variable variable in the regions are 

• model:variable@r0 

• model:variable@r1 

```python
devsim.interface_model(device="device", interface="interface", name="continuousPotential:Potential@r0", equation="1")
devsim.interface_model(device="device", interface="interface", name="continuousPotential:Potential@r1", equation="-1") 
```

## 5.3.3 Interface equation assembly

There are three types of interface equations considered in DEVSIM. They are both activated using the devsim.interface_equation() (page 90). 

In the first form, continuous, the equations for the nodes on both sides of the interface are integrated with respect to their volumes and added into the same equation. An additional equation is then specified to relate the variables on both sides. In this example, continuity in the potential solution across the interface is enforced, using the continuousPotential model defined in the previous section. 

```python
devsim.interface_equation(device="device", interface="interface", name="PotentialEquation", interface_model="continuousPotential", type="continuous") 
```

In the second form, fluxterm, a flux term is integrated over the surface area of the interface and added to the first region, and subtracted from the second. 

In the third form, hybrid, equations for nodes on both sides of the interface are added into the equation for the node in the first region. The equation for the node on the second interface is integrated in the second region, and the fluxterm is subracted in the second region. 

## 5.4 Contact

![](images/4d98e008226bfdefd471c7253303956c13304fb0068420d9c1b62ae1ce8fee09.jpg)



Fig. 5.5: Contact constructs in 2D.


## 5.4.1 Contact models

Contact constructs in 2D. (page 30) depicts how a contact is treated in a simulation. It is a collection of nodes on a region. During assembly, the specified models form an equation, which replaces the equation applied to these nodes for a bulk node. 

Contact models are equivalent to node and edge models, and are specified using the devsim. contact_node_model() (page 99) and the devsim.contact_edge_model() (page 99), respectively. The key difference is that the models are only evaluated on the contact nodes for the contact specified. 

## 5.4.2 Contact model derivatives

The derivatives are equivalent to the discussion in Model derivatives (page 26). If external circuit boundary conditions are being used, the model model derivative with respect to the circuit node node name should be specified as model:node. 

## 5.4.3 Contact equation assembly

The devsim.contact_equation() (page 86) is used to specify the boundary conditions on the contact nodes. The models specified replace the models specified for bulk equations of the same name. For example, the node model specified for the contact equation is assembled on the contact nodes, instead of the node model specified for the bulk equation. Contact equation models not specified are not assembled, even if the model exists on the bulk equation for the region attached to the contact. 

As an example 

```javascript
devsim.contact_equation(device="device", contact="contact", name="PotentialEquation", node_model="contact_bc", edge_charge_model="DField") 
```

Current models refer to the instantaneous current flowing into the device. Charge models refer to the instantaneous charge at the contact. 

During a transient, small-signal or ac simulation, the time derivative is taken so that the net current into a circuit node is 

$$
I (t) = i (t) + \frac {\partial q (t)}{\partial t}
$$

where i is the integrated current and q is the integrated charge. 

## 5.5 Custom matrix assembly

The devsim.custom_equation() (page 87) command is used to register callbacks to be called during matrix and right hand side assembly. The Python procedure should expect to receive two arguments and return two lists and a boolean value. For example a procedure named myassemble registered with 

```javascript
devsim.custom_equation(name="test1", procedure="myassemble") 
```

expects two arguments 

```python
def myassemble(what, timemode):
    .
    .
    .
    return rcv, rv, True 
```

where what may be passed as one of 

```txt
MATRIXONLY
RHS
MATRIXANDRHS 
```

and timemode may be passed as one of 

## 5.5. Custom matrix assembly

```txt
DC
TIME 
```

When timemode is DC, the time-independent part of the equation is returned. When timemode is TIME, the time-derivative part of the equation is returned. The simulator will scale the timederivative terms with the proper frequency or time scale. 

The return value from the procedure must return two lists and a boolean value of the form 

[1 1 1.0 2 2 1.0 1 2 -1.0 2 1 -1.0 2 2 1.0], [1 1.0 2 1.0 2 -1.0], True 

where the length of the first list is divisible by 3 and contains the row, column, and value to be assembled into the matrix. The second list is divisible by 2 and contains the right hand side entries. Either list may be empty. 

The boolean value denotes whether the matrix and right hand side entries should be row permutated. A value of True should be used for assembling bulk equations, and a value of False should be used for assembling contact and interface boundary conditions. 

The devsim.get_circuit_equation_number() (page 85) may be used to get the equation numbers corresponding to circuit node names. The devsim.get_equation_numbers() (page 89) may be used to find the equation number corresponding to each node index in a region. 

The matrix and right hand side entries should be scaled by the NodeVolume if they are assembled into locations in a device region as volume integration. 

## 5.6 Cylindrical coordinate systems

In 2D, models representing the edge couples, surface areas and node volumes may be generated using the following commands: 

• devsim.cylindrical_edge_couple() (page 99) 

• devsim.cylindrical_node_volume() (page 100) 

• devsim.cylindrical_surface_area() (page 100) 

In order to change the integration from the default models to cylindrical models, the following parameters may be set 

```python
set_parameter(name="node_volume_model", value="CylindricalNodeVolume")
set_parameter(name="edge_couple_model", value="CylindricalEdgeCouple")
set_parameter(name="edge_node0_volume_model", value="CylindricalEdgeNodeVolume@n0")
set_parameter(name="edge_node1_volume_model", value="CylindricalEdgeNodeVolume@n1")
set_parameter(name="element_edge_couple_model", value="ElementCylindricalEdgeCouple")
set_parameter(name="element_node0_volume_model", 
```

(continues on next page) 

```txt
value="ElementCylindricalNodeVolume@en0")
set_parameter(name="element_node1_volume_model", value="ElementCylindricalNodeVolume@en1") 
```

(continued from previous page) 

## 5.7 Notes

## 5.7.1 Interface

## Interace equation coupling

The name0, and name1 options are now available for the devsim.interface_equation() (page 90) command. They make it possible to couple dissimilar equation names across regions. 

## Interface and contact surface area

Interface surface area is stored in the SurfaceArea node model. Contact surface area is stored in the ContactSurfaceArea node model. These are listed in Table 5.1. 

## Skip nodes shared with contact

Interface equation assembly skips nodes when an interface node is shared with a contact. Best to be avoided. Share helper script. 

## 5.7.2 Element assembly

The EdgeNodeVolume model is now available for the volume contained by an edge and is referenced in Edge models (page 24). 

The devsim.equation() (page 87) supports these options: 

• volume_node0_model 

• volume_node1_model 

This makes it possible to better integrate nodal quantities on the volumes of element edges. For example, a field dependent generation-recombination rate can be volume integrated separately for each node of an element edge. 

The devsim.contact_equation() (page 86) supports the following options: 

• edge_volume_model 

• volume_node0_model 

• volume_node1_model 

This makes it possible to integrate edge and element edge quantities with respect to the volume on nodes of the edge at the contact. This is similar to devsim.equation() (page 87). 

The integration parameters for edge_volume_model are set with 

• edge_node0_volume_model (default EdgeNodeVolume Edge models (page 24) ) 

• edge_node1_volume_model (default EdgeNodeVolume) 

and for volume_model with: 

• element_node0_volume_model (default ElementNodeVolume Element edge models defined on each region of a device (page 25)) 

• element_node1_volume_model (default ElementNodeVolume) 

These parameters are applicable to both devsim.equation() (page 87) devsim. contact_equation() (page 86). 

## 5.7.3 Edge volume model

The devsim.equation() (page 87) suppports the edge_volume_model. This makes it possible to integrate edge quantities properly so that it is integrated with respect to the volume on nodes of the edge. To set the node volumes for integration, it is necessary to define a model for the node volumes on both nodes of the edge. For example: 

```python
devsim.edge_model(device="device", region="region", name="EdgeNodeVolume", equation="0.5*EdgeCouple*EdgeLength")
set_parameter(name="edge_node0_volume_model", value="EdgeNodeVolume")
set_parameter(name="edge_node1_volume_model", value="EdgeNodeVolume") 
```

For the cylindrical coordinate system in 2D, please see Cylindrical coordinate systems (page 32). 

## 5.7.4 Element pair from edge model

The devsim.element_pair_from_edge_model() (page 106) command is available to calculate element edge components averaged onto each node of the element edge. This makes it possible to create an edge weighting scheme different from those used in devsim. element_from_edge_model() (page 104). The examples examples/diode/laux2d.py (2D) and examples/diode/laux3d.py (3D) compare the built-in implementations of these commands with equivalent implementations written in Python 

## Chapter 6

## Parameters

## 6.1 Parameters

Parameters are set globally, on devices, or on regions of a device. The models on each device region are automatically updated whenever parameters change. 

```python

## 6.3 Notes

Parameters may be used in model expressions. If a parameter is not found, then DEVSIM will also look for a circuit node by the name used in the model expression. 

## Chapter 7

## Circuits

## 7.1 Overview

Circuit boundary conditions allow multi-device simulation. They are also required for setting sources and their response for AC and noise analysis. Circuit elements, such as voltage sources, current sources, resistors, capacitors, and inductors may be specified. 

## 7.2 Circuit elements

Circuit elements are manipulated using the commands in Circuit commands (page 84). Using the devsim.circuit_element() (page 84) to add a circuit element will implicitly create the nodes being references. 

A simple resistor divider with a voltage source would be specified as: 

```python
devsim.circuit_element(name="V1", n1="1", n2="0", value=1.0)
devsim.circuit_element(name="R1", n1="1", n2="2", value=5.0)
devsim.circuit_element(name="R2", n1="2", n2="0", value=5.0) 
```

Circuit nodes are created automatically when referred to by these commands. Voltage sources create an additional circuit node of the form V1.I to account for the current flowing through it. 

## 7.3 Connecting devices

For devices to contribute current to an external circuit, the devsim.contact_equation() (page 86) should use the circuitnode option to specify the circuit node in which to integrate its current. This option does not create a node in the circuit. No circuit boundary condition for the contact equation will exist if the circuit node does not actually exist in the circuit. The devsim. circuit_node_alias() (page 85) may be used to associate the name specified on the contact equation to an existing circuit node on the circuit. 

The circuit node names may be used in any model expression on the regions and interfaces. However, the simulator will only take derivatives with respect to circuit nodes names on models used to compose the contact equation. 

## 7.4 Clearing circuit

The devsim.delete_circuit() (page 85) command may be used to remove the circuit completely. 

## Chapter 8

## Meshing

## 8.1 1D mesher

DEVSIM has an internal 1D mesher and the proper sequence of commands follow in this example. 

```python
devsim.create_1d_mesh(mesh="cap")
devsim.add_1d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", pos=0, ps=0.1, tag="top")
devsim.add_1d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", pos=0.5, ps=0.1, tag="mid")
devsim.add_1d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", pos=1, ps=0.1, tag="bot")
devsim.add_1d_contact(mesh="cap", name="top", tag="top", material="metal")
devsim.add_1d_contact(mesh="cap", name="bot", tag="bot", material="metal")
devsim.add_1d_interface(mesh="cap", name="MySiOx", tag="mid")
devsim.add_1d_region(mesh="cap", material="Si", region="MySiRegion", tag1="top", tag2="mid")
devsim.add_1d_region(mesh="cap", material="Ox", region="MyOxRegion", tag1="mid", tag2="bot")
devsim.finalize_mesh(mesh="cap")
devsim.create_device(mesh="cap", device="device") 
```

The devsim.create_1d_mesh() (page 96) is first used to initialize the specification of a new mesh by the name specified with the command option. The devsim.add_1d_mesh_line() (page 93) is used to specify the end points of the 1D structure, as well as the location of points where the spacing changes. The command is used to create reference labels used for specifying the contacts, interfaces and regions. 

The devsim.add_1d_contact() (page 93), devsim.add_1d_interface() (page 93) and devsim. add_1d_region() (page 93) are used to specify the contacts, interfaces and regions for the device. 

Once the meshing commands have been completed, the devsim.finalize_mesh() (page 98) is called to create a mesh structure and then devsim.create_device() (page 96) is used to create a device using the mesh. 

## 8.2 2D mesher

Similar to the 1D mesher, the 2D mesher uses a sequence of non-terminating mesh lines are specified in both the x and y directions to specify a mesh structure. As opposed to using tags, the regions are specified using devsim.add_2d_region() (page 95) as box coordinates on the mesh coordinates. The contacts and interfaces are specified using boxes, however it is best to ensure the the interfaces and contacts encompass only one line of points. 

```python
devsim.create_2d_mesh(mesh="cap")
devsim.add_2d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", dir="y", pos=-0.001, ps=0.001)
devsim.add_2d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", dir="x", pos=xmin, ps=0.1)
devsim.add_2d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", dir="x", pos=xmax, ps=0.1)
devsim.add_2d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", dir="y", pos=ymin, ps=0.1)
devsim.add_2d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", dir="y", pos=ymax, ps=0.1)
devsim.add_2d_mesh_line(mesh="cap", dir="y", pos=+1.001, ps=0.001)
devsim.add_2d_region(mesh="cap", material="gas", region="gas1", yl=-.001, yh=0.0)
devsim.add_2d_region(mesh="cap", material="gas", region="gas2", yl=1.0, yh=1.001)
devsim.add_2d_region(mesh="cap", material="Oxide", region="r0", xl=xmin, xh=xmax, yl=ymid1, yh=ymin)
devsim.add_2d_region(mesh="cap", material="Silicon", region="r1", xl=xmin, xh=xmax, yl=ymid2, yh=ymid1)
devsim.add_2d_region(mesh="cap", material="Silicon", region="r2", xl=xmin, xh=xmax, yl=ymid2, yh=ymax)

devsim.add_2d_interface(mesh="cap", name="i0", region0="r0", region1="r1")
devsim.add_2d_interface(mesh="cap", name="i1", region0="r1", region1="r2", xl=0, xh=1, yl=ymid2, yh=ymid2, bloat=1.0e-10)
devsim.add_2d_contact(mesh="cap", name="top", region="r0", yl=ymin, yh=ymin, bloat=1.0e-10, material="metal")
devsim.add_2d_contact(mesh="cap", name="bot", region="r2", yl=ymax, yh=ymax, bloat=1.0e-10, material="metal")
devsim.finalize_mesh(mesh="cap")
devsim.create_device(mesh="cap", device="device") 
```

In the current implementation of the software, it is necessary to create a region on both sides of the contact in order to create a contact using devsim.add_2d_contact() (page 94) or an interface using devsim.add_2d_interface() (page 94). 

Once the meshing commands have been completed, the devsim.finalize_mesh() (page 98) is called to create a mesh structure and then devsim.create_device() (page 96) is used to create a device using the mesh. 

## 8.3 Using an external mesher

## 8.3.1 Gmsh

The Gmsh meshing software (see Gmsh (page 12)) can be used to create a 1D, 2D, or 3D mesh suitable for use in DEVSIM. DEVSIM supports reading version 2.2 meshes from Gmsh. In order to write this format, it is necessary to specify the mesh format when writing out a mesh file. From the gmsh command line, use the -format msh2 option. 

When creating the mesh file using the software, use physical group names to map the difference entities in the resulting mesh file to a group name. 

In this example, a MOS structure is read in: 

```python
devsim.create_gmsh_mesh(file="gmsh_mos2d.msh", mesh="mos2d")
devsim.add_gmsh_region(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="bulk", region="bulk", material="Silicon")
devsim.add_gmsh_region(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="oxide", region="oxide", material="Silicon")
devsim.add_gmsh_region(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="gate", region="gate", material="Silicon")
devsim.add_gmsh_contact(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="drain_contact", region="bulk", name="drain", material="metal")
devsim.add_gmsh_contact(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="source_contact", region="bulk", name="source", material="metal")
devsim.add_gmsh_contact(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="body_contact", region="bulk", name="body", material="metal")
devsim.add_gmsh_contact(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="gate_contact", region="gate", name="gate", material="metal")
devsim.add_gmsh_interface(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="gate_oxide_interface", region0="gate", region1="oxide", name="gate_oxide")
devsim.add_gmsh_interface(mesh="mos2d" gmsh_name="bulk_oxide_interface", region0="bulk", region1="oxide", name="bulk_oxide")
devsim.finalize_mesh(mesh="mos2d")
devsim.create_device(mesh="mos2d", device="mos2d") 
```

Once the meshing commands have been completed, the devsim.finalize_mesh() (page 98) is called to create a mesh structure and then devsim.create_device() (page 96) is used to create a device using the mesh. 

## 8.3.2 Custom mesh loading using scripting

It is also possible to arbitrarily load a mesh from a Python using the devsim.create_gmsh_mesh() (page 97). This is explained in the Notes section of the command. In addition, please see the testing/pythonmesh1d script for a simple demonstration script. These meshes may only contain points, lines, triangles, and tetrahedra. Hybrid meshes or uniform meshes containing other elements are not supported at this time. 

## 8.4 Loading and saving results

The devsim.write_devices() (page 98) is used to create an ASCII file suitable for saving data for restarting the simulation later. The devsim format encodes structural information, as well as the commands necessary for generating the models and equations used in the simulation. The devsim_data format is used for storing numerical information for use in other programs for analysis. The devsim.load_devices() (page 98) is then used to reload the device data for restarting the simulation. 

## 8.5 Mesh processing

See Examples (page 63) for examples involving mesh processing. 

## 8.6 Notes

## 8.6.1 Contacts

## Contact material

Contacts requires a material setting (e.g. metal). This is for informational purposes. Contact models still look up parameter values based on the region they are located. 

## Create contacts from interface

The devsim.create_contact_from_interface() (page 96) may be used to create a contact at the location of an interface. This is useful when contact boundary conditions are needed for a region connected to the interface. 

## 8.6.2 Device and mesh deletion commands

The devsim.delete_device() (page 98) command makes it possible to delete devices so they will no longer be solved in the simulation. Any parameters set on the device are also removed from the system. 

The devsim.delete_mesh() (page 98) command makes it possible to delete meshes. Once a mesh has been deleted, it is no longer possible to create devices from it using the devsim. create_device() (page 96) command. 

## 8.6.3 Periodic boundary conditions

The devsim.create_interface_from_nodes() (page 97) command makes it possible to create an interface with non coincident nodes. This enables the use of periodic boundary conditions. 

## Chapter 9

# Solver and numerics

## 9.1 Overview

DEVSIM offers a range of simulation algorithms. 

DC The DC operating point analysis is useful for performing steady-state simulation for a different bias conditions. 

AC At each DC operating point, a small-signal AC analysis may be performed. An AC source is provided through a circuit and the response is then simulated. This is useful for both quasi-static capacitance simulation, as well as RF simulation. 

Noise/Sensitivity Noise analysis may be used to evaluate how internal noise sources are observed in the terminal currents of the device or circuit. Using this method, it is also possible to simulate how the device response changes when device parameters are changed. 

Transient DEVSIM is able to simulate the nonlinear transient behavior of devices, when the bias conditions change with time. 

## 9.2 Solution methods

DEVSIM uses Newton methods to solve the system of PDE’s. All of the analyses are performed using the devsim.solve() (page 114). 

## 9.2.1 DC analysis

A DC analysis is performed using the devsim.solve() (page 114). 



solve(type="dc", absolute_error=1.0e10, relative_error=1e-7 maximum_iterations=30) 



## 9.2.2 AC analysis

An AC analysis is performed using the devsim.solve() (page 114). A circuit voltage source is required to set the AC source. 

## 9.2.3 Noise and sensitivity analysis

An noise analysis is performed using the devsim.solve() (page 114) command. A circuit node is specified in order to find its sensitivity to changes in the bulk quantities of each device. If the circuit node is named V1.I. A noise simulation is performed using: 

```txt
solve(type="noise", frequency=1e5, output_node="V1.I") 
```

Noise and sensitivity analysis is performed using the devsim.solve() (page 114). If the equation begin solved is PotentialEquation, the names of the scalar impedance field is then: 

• V1.I_PotentialEquation_real 

• V1.I_PotentialEquation_imag 

and the vector impedance fields evaluated on the nodes are 

• V1.I_PotentialEquation_real_gradx 

• V1.I_PotentialEquation_imag_gradx 

• V1.I_PotentialEquation_real_grady (2D and 3D) 

• V1.I_PotentialEquation_imag_grady (2D and 3D) 

• V1.I_PotentialEquation_real_gradz (3D only) 

• V1.I_PotentialEquation_imag_gradz (3D only) 

## 9.2.4 Transient analysis

Transient analysis is performed using the devsim.solve() (page 114). DEVSIM supports timeintegration of the device PDE’s. The three methods are supported are: 

• BDF1 

• TRBDF 

• BDF2 

## 9.3 Extended precision

## 9.3.1 Platform dependence

Extended precision is available on all binaries. For Linux x86_64, this uses the 128-bit precision available with the GCC compilers. On other platforms, x64, arm64, aarch64, the cpp_bin_float_quad type is used from the boost libraries, and is similar to 128-bit precision. 

## 9.3.2 How to control

The following new parameters are available: 

• extended_solver, extended precision matrix for Newton and linear solver 

• extended_model, extended precision model evaluation 

• extended_equation, extended precision equation assembly 

Default geometric models, are also calculated with extended precision. 

```python
devsim.set_parameter(name = "extended_solver", value=True)
devsim.set_parameter(name = "extended_model", value=True)
devsim.set_parameter(name = "extended_equation", value=True) 
```

## 9.3.3 Kahan summation in extended precision mode

The kahan3 and kahan4 functions use the Kahan summation algorithm for extended precision model evaluation. With this change, better than 128-bit floating precision is available when extended precision is enabled. 

```python
devsim.set_parameter(name = "extended_model", value=True) 
```

The testing/kahan_float128.py script demonstrates this. 

## 9.4 Floating point exceptions

## 9.4.1 FPE checking during external solve

On arm64 and aarch64 platforms, the software does not check for floating point exceptions (FPEs) during usage of the direct solver. During testing, it was discovered that FPEs were occuring during factorization for both the SuperLU and the UMFPACK 5.1. Removing this check allows more of the tests to run through to completion. 

## 9.4.2 Additional Information

Please see Floating point exceptions (page 16). 

## 9.5 Solver and math library selection

## 9.5.1 Available libraries

## Intel Math Kernel Library

A specific version is not required when loading the Intel Math Kernel Library. This method is the default for x64 and x86_64 systems. Instructions for installing in a Python virtual environment are given in Create virtual environment (page 10). 

UMFPACK 5.1 solver 

The UMFPACK 5.1 solver is now available as a shared library distributed with the software. It is licensed under the terms of the LGPL 2.1 and our version is hosted here: 

https://github.com/devsim/umfpack_lgpl 

Please note that this version uses a scheme to detect the BLAS/LAPACK libraries being used by DEVSIM, as described in BLAS/LAPACKlibrary selection (page 49). 

In order to use this library, a shim script is provided to load UMFPACK 5.1 and set it as the solver. Please see this example: 

python -mdevsim.umfpack.umfshim ssac_cap.py 

## Custom solver

Please see Custom direct solver (page 50) for more information. 

SuperLU 

SuperLU is no longer available as a solver in the binary distributions of DEVSIM. It is available for custom applications, which would require a custom build of the software. 

## 9.5.2 Automatic direct solver selection

UMFPACK 5.1 is the default when the Intel Math Kernel Library is not available, making this the default for the macOS arm64 platform. 

The direct solver may be selected by using the direct_solver parameter. 

```python
devsim.set_parameter(name='direct_solver', value='mkl_pardiso') 
```

All compatible platforms will search for the Intel MKL Pardiso. The default is mkl_pardiso when the Intel Math Kernel Library is loaded. The umfshim described in UMFPACK 5.1 solver (page 48) uses the custom option for this parameter to implement calls using the custom solver callback system described in Custom direct solver (page 50). 

## 9.5.3 BLAS/LAPACK library selection

Reference versions are available from https://netlib.org. There are optimized versions available from other vendors. It is possible to load alternative implementations of the BLAS/LAPACK used by the software. The DEVSIM_MATH_LIBS environment variable may be used to set a : separated list of libraries. These names may be based on relative or absolute paths. The program will load the libraries in order, and stop when all of the necessary math symbols are supplied. If symbols for the Intel Math Kernel Library are detected, then the Pardiso direct solver will be enabled. 

Linux example: 

```shell
export DEVSIM_MATH_LIBS=libblas.so:liblapack.so 
```

Apple macOS example: 

```txt
export DEVSIM_MATH_LIBS=libblas.dylib:liblapack.dylib 
```

On Windows the DEVSIM_MATH_LIBS uses the ; as the path separator, while macOS and Linux still use :. 

The math library search order is then: 

• The math libraries listed in the DEVSIM_MATH_LIBS environment variable, with the appropriate separator. 

• The Intel Math Kernel Library 

• These dynamic libraries * OpenBLAS (e.g. libopenblas.so) * LAPACK (e.g. liblapack.so) * BLAS (e.g. libblas.so) 

## 9.5.4 Default math search path

It is recommended to use the full path for all of the math solver libraries. On macOS and Linux, the RPATH has been modified to look in places relative to the devsim module, instead of using CONDA_PREFIX or VIRTUAL_ENV. 

• macOS @loader_path;@loader_path/../lib;@loader_path/../../../../lib; @executable_path/../lib 

```makefile
- Linux: $ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib:$ORIGIN/../../../lib 
```

## 9.5.5 Determine loaded math libraries

To determine the loaded math libraries, use 

```python
devsim.get_parameter(name='info')['math_libraries'] 
```

## 9.6 Custom direct solver

It is call a custom direct solver. The direct solver is called from Python and the callback is implemented by setting these parameters: 

parameter table 

```python
devsim.set_parameter(name="direct_solver", value="custom")
devsim.set_parameter(name="solver_callback", value=local_solver_callback) 
```

Where the first parameter enables the use of the second parameter to set a callback function. Please see the testing/umfpack_shim.py for a sample implementation using UMFPACK 5.1. 

## 9.7 Diagnostics

## 9.7.1 Problem node identification

The node indexes with the maximum error for each equation will be printed when debug_level is verbose. 

```txt
devsim.set_parameter(name="debug_level", value="verbose") 
```

These are printed as RelErrorNode and AbsErrorNode: 

```txt
Region: "gate" RelError: 5.21531e-14 AbsError: 4.91520e+04
Equation: "ElectronContinuityEquation" RelError: 4.91520e-16 AbsError: 4.
→91520e+04
RelErrorNode: 129 AbsErrorNode: 129 
```

## 9.6. Custom direct solver

This information is also returned when using the info=True option on the devsim.solve() (page 114) command for each equation on each region of a device. 

If the info flag is set to True on the solve command, the iteration information will be returned, and an exception for convergence will no longer be thrown. It is the responsibility of the caller to test the result of the solve command to see if the simulation converged. Other types of exceptions, such as floating point errors, will still result in a Python exception that needs to be caught. 

## 9.7.2 Convergence information

The devsim.solve() (page 114) now supports the info option. The solve command will then return convergence information. 

## 9.8 Symbolic factorization reuse

The Intel Math Kernel Library solver will now use reuse the symbolic factorization, if the simulation matrix sparse matrix pattern has not changed after the second nonlinear solver iteration. This reduces simulation time, but can result in numerical differences in the simulation result. Setting the environment variable, DEVSIM_NEW_SYMBOLIC, will do a new symbolic factorization for each iteration. 

This behavior may be controlled by using this option in the devsim.solve() (page 114) command 

```python
solve(symbolic_iteration_limit = -1) 
```

where setting the value to -1 will create a new symbolic factorization for all nonlinear iterations. Setting the value to a number greater than 0 will mark all iterations afterwards for reusing the previous symbolic factorization. 

## 9.9 Notes

## 9.9.1 Convergence tests

The maximum_error and maximum_divergence options were added to the devsim.solve() (page 114) command. If the absolute error of any iteration goes above maximum_error, the simulation stops with a convergence failure. The maximum_divergence is the maximum number of iterations that the simulator error may increase before stopping. 

## 9.9.2 Simulation matrix

The devsim.get_matrix_and_rhs() (page 114) command was not properly accepting the format parameter, and was always returning the same type. 

## 9.9.3 Get matrix and rhs for external use

The devsim.get_matrix_and_rhs() (page 114) command has been added to assemble the static and dynamic matrices, as well as their right hand sides, based on the current state of the device being simulated. The format option is used to specify the sparse matrix format, which may be either in the compressed column or compressed row formats, csc or csr. 

## 9.9.4 Transient analysis

devsim.set_initial_condition() (page 114) to set initial transient condition as alternative to using the transient_dc option to the devsim.solve() (page 114) command. Suitable options for this command may be provided from the get_matrix_and_rhs() command. 

# Chapter 10

## SYMDIFF

## 10.1 Overview

SYMDIFF is a tool capable of evaluating derivatives of symbolic expressions. Using a natural syntax, it is possible to manipulate symbolic equations in order to aid derivation of equations for a variety of applications. It has been tailored for use within DEVSIM. 

## 10.2 Syntax

## 10.2.1 Variables and numbers

Variables and numbers are the basic building blocks for expressions. A variable is defined as any sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by letters, integer digits, and the _ character. Note that the letters are case sensitive so that a and {A} are not the same variable. Any other characters are considered to be either mathematical operators or invalid, even if there is no space between the character and the rest of the variable name. 

Examples of valid variable names are: 

a, dog, var1, var_2 

Numbers can be integer or floating point. Scientific notation is accepted as a valid syntax. For example: 

1.0, 1.0e-2, 3.4E-4 

## 10.2.2 Basic expressions


Table 10.1: Basic expressions involving unary, binary, and logical operators


<table><tr><td>Expression</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>(exp1)</td><td>Parenthesis for changing precedence</td></tr><tr><td>+exp1</td><td>Unary Plus</td></tr><tr><td>-exp1</td><td>Unary Minus</td></tr><tr><td>!exp1</td><td>Logical Not</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 ^ exp2</td><td>Exponentiation</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 * exp2</td><td>Multiplication</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 / exp2</td><td>Division</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 + exp2</td><td>Addition</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 - exp2</td><td>Subtraction</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 &lt; exp2</td><td>Test Less</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 &lt;= exp2</td><td>Test Less Equal</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 &gt; exp2</td><td>Test Greater</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 &gt;= exp2</td><td>Test Greater Equal</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 == exp2</td><td>Test Equality</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 != exp2</td><td>Test Inequality</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 &amp;&amp; exp2</td><td>Logical And</td></tr><tr><td>exp1 || exp2</td><td>Logical Or</td></tr><tr><td>variable</td><td>Independent Variable</td></tr><tr><td>number</td><td>Integer or decimal number</td></tr></table>

In Basic expressions involving unary, binary, and logical operators (page 54), the basic syntax for the language is presented. An expression may be composed of variables and numbers tied together with mathematical operations. Order of operations is from bottom to top in order of increasing precedence. Operators with the same level of precedence are contained within horizontal lines. 

In the expression a + b * c, the multiplication will be performed before the addition. In order to override this precedence, parenthesis may be used. For example, in (a + b) * c, the addition operation is performed before the multiplication. 

The logical operators are based on non zero values being true and zero values being false. The test operators evaluate the numerical values and result in 0 for false and 1 for true. 

It is important to note since values are based on double precision arithmetic, testing for equality with values other than 0.0 may yield unexpected results.

In Predefined functions (page 55) are the built in functions of SYMDIFF. Note that the pow function uses the , operator to separate arguments. In addition an expression like pow(a,b+y) is equivalent to an expression like a^(b+y). Both exp and log are provided since many derivative expressions can be expressed in terms of these two functions. It is possible to nest expressions within functions and vice-versa. Error functions (page 56) lists the error functions, derivatives, and inverses. Fermi Integral functions (page 56) lists the Fermi functions, and are based on the Joyce-Dixon Approximation [3]. The Gauss-Fermi functions are listed in Gauss-Fermi Integral functions (page 56), based on [6]. 

## 10.2.4 Commands


Table 10.6: Commands


<table><tr><td>Command</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>diff(obj1, var)</td><td>Take derivative of obj1 with respect to variable var</td></tr><tr><td>expand(obj)</td><td>Expand out all multiplications into a sum of products</td></tr><tr><td>help</td><td>Print description of commands</td></tr><tr><td>scale(obj)</td><td>Get constant factor</td></tr><tr><td>sign(obj)</td><td>Get sign as 1 or -1</td></tr><tr><td>simplify(obj)</td><td>Simplify as much as possible</td></tr><tr><td>subst(obj1,obj2,obj3)</td><td>substitute obj3 for obj2 into obj1</td></tr><tr><td>unscaledval(obj)</td><td>Get value without constant scaling</td></tr><tr><td>unsignedval(obj)</td><td>Get unsigned value</td></tr></table>

Commands are shown in Commands (page 57). While they appear to have the same form as functions, they are special in the sense that they manipulate expressions and are never present in the expression which results. For example, note the result of the following command 

```txt
> diff(a*b, b)
a 
```

## 10.2.5 User functions


Table 10.7: Commands for user functions


<table><tr><td>Command</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>clear(name)</td><td>Clears the name of a user function</td></tr><tr><td>declare(name(arg1, arg2, ...))</td><td>declare function name taking dummy arguments arg1, arg2, ... . Derivatives assumed to be 0</td></tr><tr><td>define(name(arg1, arg2, ..., obj1, obj2, ...)</td><td>declare function name taking arguments arg1, arg2, ... having corresponding derivatives obj1, obj2, ...</td></tr></table>

Commands for specifying and manipulating user functions are listed in Commands for user functions (page 57). They are used in order to define new user function, as well as the derivatives of the functions with respect to the user variables. For example, the following expression defines a function named f which takes one argument. 

```txt
> define(f(x), 0.5*x) 
```

The list after the function protoype is used to define the derivatives with respect to each of the independent variables. Once defined, the function may be used in any other expression. In additions the any expression can be used as an arguments. For example: 

```lisp
> diff(f(x*y),x)
((0.5 * (x * y)) * y)
> simplify((0.5 * (x * y)) * y)
(0.5 * x * (y^2)) 
```

The chain rule is applied to ensure that the derivative is correct. This can be expressed as 

$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(u,v,\ldots) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial u} f(u,v,\ldots) + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial v} f(u,v,\ldots) + \dots$ 

The declare command is required when the derivatives of two user functions are based on one another. For example: 

```txt
>declare(cos(x))  
cos(x)  
>define(sin(x),cos(x))  
sin(x)  
>define(cos(x),-sin(x))  
cos(x) 
```

When declared, a functions derivatives are set to 0, unless specified with a define command. It is now possible to use these expressions as desired. 

```lisp
> diff(sin(cos(x)),x)
(cos(cos(x)) * (-sin(x)))
> simplify(cos(cos(x)) * (-sin(x)))
(-cos(cos(x)) * sin(x)) 
```

## 10.2.6 Macro assignment

The use of macro assignment allows the substitution of expressions into new expressions. Every time a command is successfully used, the resulting expression is assigned to a special macro definition, $_. 

In this example, the result of the each command is substituted into the next. 

```diff
> a+b
(a + b)
> $_-b
((a + b) - b)
> simplify($_)
a 
```

In addition to the default macro definition, it is possible to specify a variable identifier by using the $ character followed by an alphanumeric string beginning with a letter. In addition to letters and numbers, a _ character may be used as well. A macro which has not previously assigned will implicitly use 0 as its value. 

This example demonstrates the use of macro assignment. 

```txt
> $a1 = a + b
(a + b)
> $a2 = a - b
(a - b)
> simplify($a1+$a2)
(2 * a) 
```

## 10.3 Invoking SYMDIFF from DEVSIM

## 10.3.1 Equation parser

The devsim.symdiff() (page 112) should be used when defining new functions to the parser. Since you do not specify regions or interfaces, it considers all strings as being independent variables, as opposed to models. Model commands (page 99) presents commands which have the concepts of models. A ; should be used to separate each statement. 

This is a sample invocation from DEVSIM 

```txt
% symdiff(expr="subst(dog * cat, dog, bear)") (bear * cat) 
```

## 10.3.2 Evaluating external math

The devsim.register_function() (page 111) is used to evaluate functions declared or defined within SYMDIFF. A Python procedure may then be used taking the same number of arguments. For example: 

```python
from math import cos
from math import sin
symdiff(expr="declare(sin(x))")
symdiff(expr="define(cos(x), -sin(x))")
symdiff(expr="define(sin(x), cos(x))")
register_function(name="cos", nargs=1)
register_function(name="sin", nargs=1) 
```

The cos and sin function may then be used for model evaluation. For improved efficiency, it is possible to create procedures written in C or C++ and load them into Python. 

## 10.3.3 Models

When used withing the model commands discussed in Model commands (page 99), DEVSIM has been extended to recognize model names in the expressions. In this situation, the derivative of a model named, model, with respect to another model, variable, is then model:variable. 

During the element assembly process, DEVSIM evaluates all models of an equation together. While the expressions in models and their derivatives are independent, the software uses a caching scheme to ensure that redundant calculations are not performed. It is recommended, however, that users developing their own models investigate creating intermediate models in order to improve their understanding of the equations that they wish to be assembled. 

## Chapter 11

# Visualization and post processing

## 11.1 Introduction

DEVSIM is able to create files for visualization tools. Information about acquiring these tools are presented in Install external software tools (page 12). 

## 11.2 Visualization software

## 11.2.1 Overview

The tools in Table 11.1 can read the file Tecplot and VTK Formats. 


Table 11.1: Open source visualization tools


<table><tr><td>ParaView</td><td>visualization tool available at https://paraview.org.</td></tr><tr><td>VisIt</td><td>visualization tool available from https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/</td></tr></table>

## 11.2.2 Using ParaView

The devsim.write_devices() (page 98) is used to create an ASCII file suitable for use in ParaView. Edge quantities are interpolated onto the node positions in the resulting structure. Element edge quantities are interpolated onto the centers of each triangle or tetrahedron in the mesh. 

```txt
write_devices(file="mos_2d_dd", type="vtk") 
```

One vtu file per device region will be created, as well as a vtm file which may be used to load all of the device regions into ParaView. 

## 11.2.3 Using VisIt

VisIt supports reading the Tecplot and ParaView formats. When using the vtk option on the devsim.write_devices() (page 98), a file with a visit filename extension is created to load the files created for ParaView. 

## 11.3 Reducing file sizes

Based on a contribution by [@simbilod](https://github.com/simbilod) devsim.write_devices() (page 98) now supports reducing the file size of data files by allowing users to specify a callback function to reduce data usage. In this example, only the NetDoping field is written to the Tecplot data file. 

```python
devsim.write_devices(
    file="mesh2d_reduced.tec",
    type="tecplot",
    include_test=lambda x: x in ("NetDoping"), 
```

## 11.4 Post processing

DEVSIM has several commands for getting information on the mesh. Those related to post processing are described in Model commands (page 99) and Geometry commands (page 90). 

See Loading and saving results (page 43) for information about loading and saving mesh information to a file. 

## 11.4.1 Index information

The coordinate_index and node_index are default node models created on a region (Table 5.1}). The edge_index is a default edge models created on a region Table 5.2. 

## 11.4.2 Element node list

The devsim.get_element_node_list() (page 90) retrieves a list of nodes for every element on a region, contact, or interface.

## Chapter 13

## Simple Examples

## 13.1 Capacitor

## 13.1.1 Overview

In this chapter, we present a capacitance simulations. The purpose is to demonstrate the use of DEVSIM with a rather simple example. The first example in 1D capacitor (page 68) is called cap1d.py and is located in the examples/capacitance directory distributed with DEVSIM. In this example, we have manually taken the derivative expressions. In other examples, we will show use of SYMDIFF to create the derivatives in an automatic fashion. The second example is in 2D capacitor (page 72). 

## 13.1.2 1D capacitor

## Equations

In this example, we are solving Poisson’s equation. In differential operator form, the equation to be solved over the structure is: 

$$
\varepsilon \nabla^ {2} \psi = 0
$$

and the contact boundary equations are 

$$
\psi_ {i} - V _ {c} = 0
$$

where $\psi _ { i }$ is the potential at the contact node and $V _ { c }$ is the applied voltage. 

## Creating the mesh

The following statements create a one-dimensional mesh which is 1 cm long with a 0.1 cm spacing. A contact is placed at 0 and 1 and are named contact1 and contact2 respectively. 

```python
from devsim import *
device="MyDevice"
region="MyRegion"

###
### Create a 1D mesh
###
create_1d_mesh (mesh="mesh1")
add_1d_mesh_line (mesh="mesh1", pos=0.0, ps=0.1, tag="contact1")
add_1d_mesh_line (mesh="mesh1", pos=1.0, ps=0.1, tag="contact2")
add_1d_contact (mesh="mesh1", name="contact1", tag="contact1", material="metal")
add_1d_contact (mesh="mesh1", name="contact2", tag="contact2", material="metal")
add_1d_region (mesh="mesh1", material="Si", region=region, tag1="contact1", tag2="contact2")
finalizeized_mesh (mesh="mesh1")
create_device (mesh="mesh1", device=device) 
```

## Setting device parameters

In this section, we set the value of the permittivity to that of SiO . 

```txt
###
### Set parameters on the region
###
set_parameter(device=device, region=region, name="Permittivity", value=3.9*8.85e-14) 
```

## Creating the models

Solving for the Potential, ψ, we first create the solution variable. 

```julia
###
### Create the Potential solution variable
###
node_solution(device=device, region=region, name="Potential") 
```

In order to create the edge models, we need to be able to refer to Potential on the nodes on each edge. 

```cmake
###
### Creates the Potential@n0 and Potential@n1 edge model
###
edge_from_node_model(device=device, region=region, node_model="Potential") 
```

We then create the ElectricField model with knowledge of Potential on each node, as well as the EdgeInverseLength of each edge. We also manually calculate the derivative of ElectricField with Potential on each node and name them ElectricField:Potential@n0 and ElectricField:Potential@n1. 

```julia
###
### Electric field on each edge, as well as its derivatives with respect to
### the potential at each node
###
edge_model(device=device, region=region, name="ElectricField",
    equation="(Potential@n0 - Potential@n1)*EdgeInverseLength")
edge_model(device=device, region=region, name="ElectricField:Potential@n0",
    equation="EdgeInverseLength")
edge_model(device=device, region=region, name="ElectricField:Potential@n1",
    equation="-EdgeInverseLength") 
```

We create DField to account for the electric displacement field. 

```txt
###
### Model the D Field
###
edge_model(device=device, region=region, name="DField", equation="Permittivity*ElectricField")

edge_model(device=device, region=region, name="DField:Potential@n0", equation="diff(Permittivity*ElectricField, Potential@n0)")

edge_model(device=device, region=region, name="DField:Potential@n1", equation="-DField:Potential@n0") 
```

The bulk equation is now created for the structure using the models and parameters we have previously defined. 

```txt
###
### Create the bulk equation
###
equation(device=device, region=region, name="PotentialEquation", variable_name="Potential", edge_model="DField", variable_update="default") 
```

## Contact boundary conditions

We then create the contact models and equations. We use the Python for loop construct and variable substitutions to create a unique model for each contact, contact1_bc and contact2_bc. 

```python
###
### Contact models and equations
###
for c in ("contact1", "contact2"):
    contact_node_model(device=device, contact=c, name="%s_bc" % c,
    equation="Potential - %s_bias" % c)

    contact_node_model(device=device, contact=c, name="%s_bc:Potential" % c,
    equation="1")

    contact_equation(device=device, contact=c, name="PotentialEquation",
    node_model="%s_bc" % c, edge_charge_model="DField") 
```

In this example, the contact bias is applied through parameters named contact1_bias and contact2_bias. When applying the boundary conditions through circuit nodes, models with respect to their names and their derivatives would be required. 

## Setting the boundary conditions

```txt
###
### Set the contact
###
set_parameter(device=device, region=region, name="contact1_bias", value=1.0e-0)
set_parameter(device=device, region=region, name="contact2_bias", value=0.0) 
```

```txt
###
### Solve
###
solve(type="dc", absolute_error=1.0, relative_error=1e-10, maximum_iterations=30) 
```

```txt
###
### Print the charge on the contacts
###
for c in ("contact1", "contact2"):
    print("contact: %s charge: %1.5e"
    % (c, get_contact_charge(device=device, contact=c, equation="PotentialEquation →")))) 
```

## Running the simulation

We run the simulation and see the results. 

```yaml
contact2
(region: MyRegion)
(contact: contact1)
(contact: contact2)
Region "MyRegion" on device "MyDevice" has equations 0:10
Device "MyDevice" has equations 0:10
number of equations 11
Iteration: 0
Device: "MyDevice" RelError: 1.00000e+00 AbsError: 1.00000e+00
Region: "MyRegion" RelError: 1.00000e+00 AbsError: 1.00000e+00
Equation: "PotentialEquation" RelError: 1.00000e+00 AbsError: 1.00000e+00
Iteration: 1
Device: "MyDevice" RelError: 2.77924e-16 AbsError: 1.12632e-16
Region: "MyRegion" RelError: 2.77924e-16 AbsError: 1.12632e-16
Equation: "PotentialEquation" RelError: 2.77924e-16 AbsError: 1.12632e-16
contact: contact1 charge: 3.45150e-13
contact: contact2 charge: -3.45150e-13 
```

Which corresponds to our expected result of 3.451510<sup>−13</sup> F/cm<sup>2</sup> for a homogenous capacitor. 

## 13.1.3 2D capacitor

This example is called cap2d.py and is located in the examples/capacitance directory distributed with DEVSIM. This file uses the same physics as the 1D example, but with a 2D structure. The mesh is built using the DEVSIM internal mesher. An air region exists with two electrodes in the simulation domain. 

## Defining the mesh

```python
from devsim import *

x1 = -24.975
x2 = -2

## 13.2 Diode

## 13.2.1 Overview

The diode examples are located in the examples/diode. They demonstrate the use of packages located in the python_packages directory to simulate drift-diffusion using the Scharfetter-Gummel method [9]. 

## 13.2.2 1D diode

## Using the python packages

For these examples, python modules are provided to supply the appropriate model and parameter settings. A listing is shown in Python package files (page 78). The devsim.python_packages module is part of the distribution. The example files in the DEVSIM distribution set the path properly when loading modules. 


Table 13.1: Python package files


<table><tr><td>model_create</td><td>Creation of models and their derivatives</td></tr><tr><td>ramp</td><td>Ramping bias and automatic stepping</td></tr><tr><td>simple_dd</td><td>Functions for calculating bulk electron and hole current</td></tr><tr><td>simple_physics</td><td>Functions for setting up device physics</td></tr></table>

For this example, diode_1d.py, the following line is used to import the relevant physics. 

```python
from devsim import *
from simple_physics import * 
```

## Creating the mesh

This creates a mesh 10<sup>−5</sup> cm long with a junction located at the midpoint. The name of the device is MyDevice with a single region names MyRegion. The contacts on either end are called top and bot. 

```python
def createMesh(device, region):
    create_1d_mesh(mesh="dio")
    add_1d_mesh_line(mesh="dio", pos=0, ps=1e-7, tag="top")
    add_1d_mesh_line(mesh="dio", pos=0.5e-5, ps=1e-9, tag="mid")
